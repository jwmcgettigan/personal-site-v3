## About Me

Hello there! Here's a little bit about myself. I'm Justin McGettigan and I'm a software developer. I live in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida) and I studied computer science at [Florida Polytechnic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Polytechnic_University). My primary interests include programming, mathematics, gaming, and web novels. I'm particularly passionate about [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [Autonomous Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot), and [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction). You'll be able to see these interests in my projects.
